Hello world! Welcome to the official Penn ADRD Trajectories, Copathology, and Heterogeneity (PATCH) Lab account for the labs of Drs. Paul A. Yushkevich, Sandhitsu R. Das, and David A. Wolk at the University of Pennsylvania. We are a subset within the Penn ADRD, FTDC, PICSL labs at UPenn.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
