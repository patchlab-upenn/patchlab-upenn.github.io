Sandhitsu (Sandy) Das trained as an electrical engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur before obtaining his Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Since then, he has been part of PICSL and Patchlab and joined the Neurology department as Research Faculty. His work broadly focuses on studying pathology and normative brain function at a macroscopic level through the use of non-invasive imaging. His current work emphasizes novel use of multimodality techniques, including in-vivo and ex-vivo imaging, to study heterogeneity in Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related disorders. In addition, Sandy is also interested in developing high-resolution imaging technologies to explore brain structure and function utilizing 7 tesla MRI.
